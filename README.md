## Unit Testing in Vue: Ins and outs

Writing tests... we're here to help you get around to it. Our friend, Dan Vega, has recently put together a complete guide to unit testing. We'd definitely recommend giving it a read if you've thought about this but aren't yet writing tests or doing a whole lot of it.

There are three parts to this Unit Testing series:

* [What to test](https://www.vuemastery.com/blog/unit-testing-vue-1)
* [Your first test](https://www.vuemastery.com/blog/Unit-Testing-in-Vue-Your-First-Test/)
* [More complex components](https://www.vuemastery.com/blog/Unit-Testing-in%20Vue-More-complex-components/)

You'll find all of these on our new blog page, if you're in the mood for browsing.
